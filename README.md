# Hyperobjects

A .NET library for creating event-sourced, REST APIs in terms of Domain-driven Design patterns.

Currently there is an ASP.NET WebAPI implementation included in the project, but the library is not tied to that implementation in principle. Future work would allow Hyperobjects to be used with e.g. Sauve.

## Introduction
The code is fairly well-documented, but familiarity with the concepts in Domain Driven Design is almost a prerequisite.
